My good friend Frans Pop died on the 20th of August 2010. We had
worked together for several years within Debian (especially within the
Debian CD team), and we had become firm friends during that time. He
was great to work with, always ready to help design new features or
pick holes and find the bugs in the stuff I was developing myself,
happy for others to dig into his own projects. On the more personal
side, we met up many times at different Free Software events like
DebConf and FOSDEM, and also for pure social things like BBQs and
parties. We shared a lot of good times.

This release of debian-cd (version 3.1.4) is the last release that
he contributed towards directly. I dedicate it to his memory.

Rest In Peace, my friend. You will be missed.
