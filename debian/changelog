  * data/bullseye: Update Debian Edu installer logo and syslinux splash image
    from src:debian-edu-artwork 2.11.5-1.
  * tools/boot/*/boot-x86: Prevent custom splash images from being modified.
    The related code seems to have been useful a long time ago (the need to use
    an RLE file and to reduce the number of colours to 16 has been dropped as of
    syslinux version 3.62). So replace obsolete code with a simple cp command.
  * debian/control: Drop Recommends: on netpbm and syslinux-utils. These are no
    longer needed now that custom splash images are used unmodified.

  * Add a "with firmware" text to the DISKINFO string when appropriate
    Closes: #944207

  * Major changes to jigdo support - add support for the new
    sha256-based v2 format so we can think about phasing out
    dependencies on md5. Will still build using md5 stuff for

  * Start jessie work; copy things from the wheezy config for now.
  * Remove older squeeze, lenny, etch dirs
  * Move code hosting from svn to git.
  * Make sure that when we call apt, we tell it to *not* use localised
    package descriptions; this causes issues during build. See #712435 in
    apt.
  * List Translation files in dists/$dist/Release too - apt looks there
    now instead of in Index, apparently.
  * Remove mention/support of the s390(x) tape options; not created by d-i
    any more, and this is causing build failures.
  * Remove mention/support of old kfreebsd 8 kernels - they are not
    created any more, and this is causing build failures.
  * Remove s390 from the arch lists in various scripts, as it's going
    away. Support remains if specifically configured yet.
  * tools/update_tasks: don't hard-code the default desktop to use,
    instead work it out directly from the dependencies of the task-desktop
    package.
  * tools/boot/jessie/*: Pull out some more common code into common.sh to
    simplify the various boot-$arch scripts. Warn about potentially
    insecure download locations.

  * Add make and gcc back to forcecd1, to allow building out of tree
    kernel wifi modules. I removed this and more earlier while cleaning
    out undocuented cruft.
    (I have not added back module-assistant so far,
    since it needs build-essential which would pull in additional

  * Tweak handling of {udeb,base}_{include,exclude} files so multi-arch
    builds should work better. Closes: #703436
  * Remove the dpkg check for debootstrap version before passing the
    --no-check-gpg option; we're not going to support debootstrap versions
    so old that they don't support this flag, *and* the dpkg-query call
    doesn't give us the right version anyway - we're using an extracted

  * When building source-only discs, cope with having multiple different
    versions of a source package:
    + make_disc_trees.pl now tracks arrays of packages when parsing
      apt-cache output
    + We'll now pull in all the extra packages included in Sources.gz
      because of Built-Using.
  * Add support for Built-Using:
    + tools/sort_deps: parse out Built-Using from Packages files too and
      pass any such data on to tools/merge_package_lists
    + tools/merge_package_lists: if we have any built-using source
      packages listed when doing a combined binary/source set, add them in
      the same way as existing listed sources.
  * Other bug fixes in tools/merge_package_lists:
    + Fix handling of multi-line Binary: fields
    + Print out the accumulated size of source packages in output also
      (fix to printf format string)
  * Update Vcs-Browser
  * Make sure the DEBIAN_KERNEL placeholder in README.* is replaced;
    switch from cpp to sed for that so it works inside quoted
    text. Closes: #699198
  * Deal with syslinux version 5.x needing to install more files for
    bootable x86 media. Thanks to Daniel Baumann for the path.
    Closes: #699884

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Update Makefile to set MKISOFS to xorriso by default when building
    images for i386/amd64. Otherwise a build that doesn't set MKISOFS
    and MKISOFS_OPTS fails.
  * Update tools/boot/wheezy/boot-x86 to not look for syslinux's source
    if $ARCHIVE_EXTRACTED_SOURCES is not set and modify CONF.sh
    to not set it by default. That option is only meaningful for
    official builds that result in a copy of the sources on the given URL.
  * Add dosfstools to Recommends since it's required by
    tools/boot/wheezy/boot-x86 for EFI support. It can't be added to Depends
    because it's not available on non-Linux systems.
  * Use debootstrap --no-check-gpg by default since many local mirrors
    are not signed (such as temporary mirrors created by simple-cdd).

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Update boot-mipsel and boot-hppa to use the which_deb script for
    better safety when extracting boot loader files.
  * Update all the relevant boot-* scripts to do the right thing when
    extracting packages and sources, depending on
    $ARCHIVE_EXTRACTED_SOURCES as above
  * Add extra text to boot messages on powerpc to tell people about how to
    select a different desktop. Thanks to Rick Thomas for the

  * Merge x86 EFI support from the EFI_support branch (Closes: #658352)
    + Pull in grub-efi for amd64 and i386
    + Lots of extra code in boot-x86:
      - pull grub EFI pieces out of the latest debian-cd_info.tar.gz
        blobs in d-i, if they're there. If so, use them to make x86 images
        bootable via EFI (both via CD and USB)
      - parse the isolinux menus already provided in the d-i build and
        generate equivalent grub menus, complete with themes for a
        reasonable layout with graphics and titles.
      - depending more and more on xorriso rather than genisoimage...
  * Add version-tracking into dependency sorting. Closes: #687949)
    + Use/parse output from a newer version of apt so that "apt-cache
      depends" will include version information on dependencies.
    + All tracking of packages now include versions, so we pass around
      hashes of {package name, comparison op, version} everywhere instead
      of simply passing package names as strings.
    + Add the APT::Cache::ShowVersion=1 option to apt-cache calls to
      turn on version reporting. Needs a locally-patched version of apt
      *for now*, but expecting that to be fixed for the Wheezy
      release. The new code degrades gracefully if version info is not
      available.
    + Add a dependency on libdpkg-perl for version comparison code.
  * Improve architecture support in which_deb. Closes: #695244
    + Check all the architectures available in the archive if we're not
      specifically told which to use (e.g. on source builds)
    + If we fail to find packages/sources for the specified package, say
      so and bail out properly.
  * Switch boot-x86 to depend on xorriso totally rather than genisoimage
    now; working UEFI support needs it. We also need very recent (1.2.6)
    xorriso for various bugfixes, ideally.

    (loading from a CD/DVD used over the network). Closes: Bug #673576
  * Explicitly add s390-tools and sysconfig-hardware for s390.
  * Tweak sort_deps:
    + Track whether a dependency chain is caused by a hard dependency
      (Depends) or soft (Recommends/Suggests). If we fail to add a package
      down the chain on a *soft* dependency, don't invalidate the entire
      chain.
    + When checking OR dependencies, *first* check to see if any of the
      options are already installed *before* trying to install the first
      option. Helps a lot with circular deps such as task-lxde-desktop ->
      task-desktop -> (task-gnome-desktop | task-lxde-desktop | etc.); in
      this case, of course task-lxde-desktop should satisfy the OR dep.
  * Tweak powerpc boot options, using 32/64 bit detection in yaboot at
    boot time. Thanks to Milan Kupcevic for the patch. Closes: #678066
  * Tweak boot-load-size for ia64 to make CDs boot again. Closes: #678883.

    + Cope with .bz2 source files too.
    + Merged and simplified the old functionality from scansources.old
      and scanpackages.old into the new script create_control.
    + Run the mkisofs step *outside* of "set -e" so that we can actually
      report errors instead of silently failing.
    + Split out the code for starting a new disc into a function.
    + Pick up on a potential bug: if we finish the last (expected) disc with

  * s390: Add boot files specifying offset and size of the initrd for booting
    from CD. Change is based on SuSE's CD boot. Many thanks to Adam Thornton,
    Mark Post and Bastian Blank for providing the pointers to the missing bits.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add support for coping with binary and source packages that are too
    large to fit. If we have to remove packages and their dependencies,
    list them in README.excluded in the root of disc 1.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add firmware-linux-nonfree to firmware list. Left firmware-linux for now
    though it is now only a dependency package.
  * Add firmware-linux-free to firmware list, as a convenient way to make
    it available along with the other firmware files. (It could, instead,
    be included directly in d-i images, if there were a udeb.)
    Closes: 566561

debian-cd (3.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Don't include brltty on netinst images as it pulls in libicu which causes
    a 5MB size increase of the image, which is out of proportion given its use.
    This should not affect users as netinst installs should normally use a
    mirror and thus the package will be installed from there if needed.
    brltty will still get included on full CDs and DVDs through forcd1.
  * Remove references to no longer used files rawlist.exclude and list.exclude.
  * Clean up no longer needed compatibility code in lenny x86 boot script.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Rename list2cds to sort_deps.
  * Fix how directory trees are created in update-cd. Closes: #503911.
  * Update update_popcon to cope better with errors; now uses curl instead
    of wget.

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Don't try to copy sbm on etch CD images as it got removed.
  * Also extract isolinux.bin from the syslinux package in the case of etch
    CD images (since it's no more provided by debian-cd itself).

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Rework the way tasks are handled:
    - all tasks files are moved to ./tasks/<codename> subdirectories so they
      can be more easily kept up-to-date with specific distro releases
    - always generate the debian-installer and tasksel tasks dynamically:
      . all task files for the desired suite are copied to the working
        directory at the beginning of each build, and are used from there
      . the debian-installer and tasksel tasks are no longer included in
        releases but are always created automatically at build time; this
        means users no longer need to run the generate_di_* scripts or the
        update_tasksel script
      . the popcon task file will remain included as a static file, but plan
        is to add an option to update it automatically for each build; reason
        is that updating it requires network access
    - bump version to 3.1
  * Update the contrib/testingcds script based on its current version on
    farbror.
  * Clean up and update interesting-fromcd23 and exclude task files for lenny.
  * Fix error in expansion of %ARCH% variables in D-I image location envvars.
  * Fix i386/amd64 multi-arch support in the lenny x86 boot script so that the
    isolinux config gets modified correctly independent of the order in which
    the arches are specified.
  * Workaround #505243 by modifying the syslinux configuration for amd64/i386
    multi-arch images and using ifcpu64.c32 to autodetect 32/64-bit systems
    when a user hits enter from the isolinux help screens. Based on research
    done by Franklin Piat.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Stop copying the /tools/ directory on from the mirror; it's going away.
  * Add support for multiple desktop tasks on a single disk
  * Add support for tracking which packages we've extracted binaries from,
    so that we can archive them (both binaries and sources). If we need
    anything, we will list it in CD$N.pkgs_extracted so that external
    scripts can pick it up and do whatever's needed.
  * Minor changes to the interface of tools/which_deb to accommodate that:
    now just lists the files *within* the mirror; it's up to callers to
    prepend ${MIRROR} as needed.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * make_image: ensure correct quoting of variables when calling genisoimage.
    Closes: #507300.
  * boot-hppa: support KERNEL_PARAMS (so desktop= can be passed).
  * boot-hppa: stop passing redundant boot parameters root and ramdisk_size.
  * Split out languages supported by D-I and tasksel from task.list files.
    Instead of duplicating what language tasks should be included in each
    task.list.* file, let update_tasks add them dynamically at runtime from a
    single list of languages supported by tasksel and D-I. This also makes
    maintaining the lists a lot less painful. Closes: #506616.
  * Indicate which tasks are "secondary" by adding a "-" suffix in task.list.*
    files instead of hardcoding it in update_tasks. Closes: #506668.
  * Add new file tasks/README.tasksel to document the way tasksel tasks are
    used when determining the order in which packages are added to images.
  * Update list of languages supported by tasksel and D-I for Lenny.
  * Add support for a separate 'LXDE desktop environment' CD.
  * Add support for a 'light desktop environment' CD (LXDE + Xfce).
    Includes a framework to manipulate the isolinux configuration for x86 so
    that a user can select which desktop he wishes to install.
  * Add support to create an 'all desktops' DVD.
    This new task will include all four desktop environments supported by
    tasksel (GNOME, KDE, LXDE and Xfce). On x86 it will also add an option in
    the isolinux menu (under Advanced options) to select which DE to install,
    but GNOME will remain default.
  * Add support for a separate 'GNOME desktop environment' CD.
    This new task is mostly added for completeness. Main difference with the
    default task file is that no server tasks are included.
  * Add a suffix "generic" to the default task files to make the overall naming
    scheme more consistent. It also allows to make update_tasks more generic.
  * Update exclude list for Lenny:
    - remove aspell* packages as they do not included on CD1 anyway and
      excluding them also means they get excluded from DVD1;
    - remove xen/vserver linux-image packages as they do not get included on
      CD1 anyway;
    - xmail and cdebconf were added as they got pulled in through alternative
      dependencies, which is no longer an issue.
  * Give priority to Key packages over regular packages for secondary tasks
    (similar to what we already did for primary tasks).
  * README.easy-build: document how to use custom packages and D-I images.
  * Add myself as uploader.

debian-cd (3.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Pre-cache apt's package information in large lumps rather than walk
    through it one package at a time. It's much faster. Closes: #470838
    Needs a small re-arrangement: code from tools/add_packages now
    moves into tools/make_disc_trees.pl
  * Update lenny's isolinux.bin to the one from syslinux 3.63+dfsg-1.
    Should help a user with an old Adaptec SCSI card who has been reporting
    problems.
  * tools/imagesums: use newer features in latest mkisofs/genisoimage to grab
    pre-calculated MD5 and SHA1 checksums directly from the jigdo file.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Remove wireless-tools-udeb from the lenny udeb_include files as it is not
    required for wireless support (see also #474708).

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add support for a split syslinux.cfg file, which will later be provided
    to support the syslinux vesa menu.

  [ Santiago Garcia ]
  * Start to add armel support.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Drop the base-{etch,lenny} tasks files as make_disc_trees.pl already takes
    care of including packages needed by debootstrap.
  * generate_di+k_list: fix logic error in use of codenames.
    When building a CD for e.g. etch using D-I from e.g. sid, the script
    should update tasks/debian-installer+kernel-etch (instead of -sid), and
    that file should have '#include <debian-installer-sid>'. This means we'll
    no longer have to modify the Debian_* tasks in such cases.

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Switch debhelper compatibility level to 5 and use debian/compat
    instead of DH_COMPAT.
  * Clean up debian/rules a bit.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add per-language desktop tasks to the task.list files.
  * Path to sparc daily builds has changed.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Update tasksel tasks for Lenny Beta2.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * tools/update_tasks: Significant streamlining to make a huge difference in
    runtime. Now feasible to run this automatically per-build rather than
    cronning it.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Update isolinux to version 3.63+dfsg-2 (featuring 'menu default64'
    support).

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * tools/make-firmware-image: Simple script to create .tar.gz and
    .zip files containing non-free firmware and microcode packages.
  * Add support for dual-layer DVD, Blu-Ray and dual-layer Blu-Ray
    discs. Nothing special, just extra sizes recognised.
  * Fix bashism in tools/grab_md5. Closes: #489562
  * Change lynx dependency to use lynx-cur|lynx instead. Closes: #489486
  * Add sanity check for data passed to add_packages.
  * Workaround to avoid errors when building images for Etch+1/2 (using
    packages from stable but D-I/udebs from testing): don't include source
    for udebs in images. See also #490652.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Support including packages from proposed-updates.
    This can be useful for pre-release testing of point releases, but should
    be used with care when CDs are intended to be published.
  * build.sh: after the earlier change in generate_di+k_list in this release,
    this script should also use the debian-installer+kernel task for the
    requested codename, and not the used D-I release.
  * build_all.sh: make setting of TASK consistent with build.sh.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Disable zd1211-firmware as its dependencies currently
    break d-i. (See #492205)

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Applied patch from Robert Millan <rmh@aybabtu.com> to allow choice of
    desktop when building for win32-loader. Closes: #491300.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Include packages needed for systems using loop-aes encryption on
    installation CDs. Closes: #486360.

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Include speakup and atl2 modules for i386 and amd64 medias.
  * Include multipath-tools-boot for all medias.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add the "-joliet-long" option when making images with Joliet names.
    Some packages with ridiculously long names are not unique in the
    first 64 characters, so normal Joliet sorting fails.
  * Cope better with source/binary package mismatches in
    tools/merge_package_lists.
  * Improve control over production of iso and jigdo files. Replace the
    simple DOJIGDO config option with MAXISOS and MAXJIGDOS, allowing
    more flexibility. Allows us to only produce a small number of iso
    images for less-popular architectures but still produce all the jigdo
    files, saving a lot of disk space.
  * Recommend syslinux-common instead of syslinux. Closes: #497966
  * Major licensing problem cleanup: (Closes: #497270)
    + Remove binary blobs from the package; pull those files from the
      .debs in the archive as needed (isolinux.bin, vesamenu.c32)
    + sbm.bin no longer needed, so dropped it
    + Pull out the code to find the right deb and put it in a new helper
      shell script (tools/which_deb), called from Makefile and boot-* as
      needed.
  * Support KERNEL_PARAMS for powerpc, alpha and sparc (Closes: #416230)
    Thanks to Vagrant Cascadian for the patch.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Allow to skip generating MD5 and SHA1 sums files.
  * Add alsa-base and alsa-utils to forcd1 for Lenny as they are no longer
    key packages in the desktop task, but we do want them on the first CD.
  * Drop support for building Sarge CDs.
  * Allow multi-arch builds using D-I images from official mirrors or local
    D-I images.
  * Add easy-build.sh, a wrapper script for building images that takes care
    of a lot of the gotchas that can make debian-cd hard to use.
  * CONF.sh: change default CODENAME to lenny; change example paths to mirror
    to /srv/mirror.
  * Exclude 686-bigmem kernel udebs as they are only used for Xen netboot.
  * Stop including jfbterm and unifont on all images; jbfterm is no longer
    installed from D-I.
  * Update and cleanup the udeb exclusion lists for lenny (general list and
    lists for i386 and amd64).

  * Applied patch from Robert Millan <rmh@aybabtu.com> to fix image
    generation with read-only mirrors. Closes: #441397.
  * Applied patch from Robert Millan <rmh@aybabtu.com> to use win32-loader
    for autorun when CD is being used on Windows. Closes: #441846.
  * Exclude dhcp-client-udeb since it's not being used and transition for
    dhcp3-client-udeb has over.
  * Exclude multipath-udeb and libaio1-udeb since they're not being use
    yet.
  * Fix autorun.inf generation when win32-loader is present.
  * Applied patch from Nicolas François <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>
    to allow README.html translation using po4a.
  * Remove the 'Last Modified' date from data/lenny/README.html.in since
    it's useless.
  * Use DEBOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT, BASE_INCLUDE and BASE_EXCLUDE variables to
    calculate the base packages set
  * Hide image creation command if not using verbosing make

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Make daily i386/amd64 lenny builds work again - don't attempt to copy
    the win32-loader files into place if they don't exist.
  * Remove Depends: on sysutils. Closes: #437497 (again)

  [ Jérémy Bobbio ]
  * README.html: Integrate a new look for README.html done by Kalle Söderman.
    Huge thanks to him!
  * README: Improve the wording when building a netinst or business card by
    being a little bit more specific than just saying: CD 1 out of 1.  This
    meant adding new defines "DISKTYPE$DISKTYPE".

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Include dmraid deb. Closes: #443991
  * Add acpi-support-base to generate_di+k_list.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Newer versions of debootstrap have moved the scripts from /usr/lib to
    /usr/share. Add a sym-link to cope - let's keep compatible with etch
    as much as possible. Also, log what debootstrap told us (in
    debootstrap-list) rather than just including the results directly in
    rawlist.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * build_all.sh: don't source CONF.sh after already sourcing $CF earlier.
  * CONF.sh: add non-invasive option to avoid sourcing CONF.sh twice when
    using wrapper scripts.
  * CONF.sh: Don't set MAXCDS by default; was probably changed by accident.
  * boot-{mipsel,sparc}: Parse website directory index case insensitive so
    that both "<a href=" and "<A HREF=" are recognized.
  * Include busybox for architectures that use initramfs-tools; base-installer
    will try to install it.
  * tools/update_tasks: ignore comments and blank lines in tasks/task.list.
  * tasks/task.list*
    - add missing l10n tasks: gujarati-desktop, malayalam-desktop, tamil
    - comment out l10n tasks for languages not supported in D-I, for
      Icelandic, Irish, Serbian, Welsh and Xhosa
  * lenny tasks: update for current task lists; set svn:keywords so the date
    header gets updated.
  * Instead of including all alternative dependencies in list2cds, only
    include the first one. This reduces the size of the netinst and improves
    what's included on CD1. Only loss is console-{data,common,tools} so these
    are now added in generate_di+k_list. Reduces impact of #410418.
  * exclude-udebs: exclude any libdirectfb udeb instead of particular version.
  * exclude-udebs: exclude kbd-udeb and console-setup udebs (not yet used).
  * During installation debootstrap will complain about an invalid Release file
    if there is no Packages file for the local section. Create an empty Packages
    file if one is missing.
  * start_new_disc: make multi-arch CD/DVDs and CD/DVDs that are not part of a
    set (e.g. KDE/Xfce CDs) recognizable through info in .disk directory.
  * Makefile: debootstrap no longer accepts options with empty values; change
    the way include/exclude options are passed accordingly.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Significant cleanup of list2cds. Closes: #451237
  * tools/imagesums: use newer features in latest mkisofs/genisoimage to grab
    pre-calculated MD5 and SHA1 checksums directly from the jigdo file.

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Make sure we include laptop-detect on arches that are know to have
    laptops (i386, amd64 and powerpc).
  * Make sure we include grub-pc since it's used when GPT disk label is
    chosen.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Fix a bug in start_new_disc - cope with MAXCDS not being set.
  * Temporarily disable boot support for arm CDs - the netwinder images are not
    being produced at the moment.

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Switch to genisoimage as default ISO generator as mkisofs has been dropped
    from Debian. Closes: #468850
  * Add Vcs-Browser field.

  * New OMIT_DOC_TOOLS option to be able to work with mirrors that do not
    contain the doc and tools directories.

  [ Frans Pop ]

debian-cd (3.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * In start_new_disc, cope with $DEBVERSION containing spaces.
  * Only put the release notes and installation guide on disc#1.
  * In list2cds, don't add udebs in the final COMPLETE run -
    they're no use there.
  * Add some munging on the Release files if we're not building
    for "testing". Used in the etch release, and I'll back it out shortly.
  * Copied etch files to lenny ready for the new testing work.

  * Removed m68k from the list of arches in generate_di+k_list and
    generate_di_list to reduce warnings.
  * Updated comments in update-cd; potato was a while ago!
  * It seems the changes for 3.0.0 completely broke extranonfree

  * Don't hack with the Release file unless EARLY_BUILD_HACK=1.

    modern kernels. (We didn't need it for etch either actually.)

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Fix for multi-arch CDs including source - the extranonfree update
    broke the source output

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Include both dhcp-client-udeb and dhcp3-client udeb while we're
    transitioning in the installer.
  * Exclude live-installer, simple-cdd, pwgen and nbd udebs as they are

  * Create dpkg status file before calling APT

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Fix boot-x86 shell syntax so it runs
  * Further logic fixing in boot-x86: amd64 should now work
  * Temporary fixup for daily lenny sparc builds - use older image locations
    if new ones not available.
  * Remove Build-Dep-Indep on sysutils. Closes: #437497
  * In build.sh, use $DI_CODENAME for installer task files rather than
    $CODENAME - allows for sid builds more easily etc.
  * Recompress the Packages files separately just before generating
    Release files. Closes: #423835, thanks to fjp for the patch.

    + arches to run

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Don't rely on PATH to find make_disc_trees.pl, start_new_disc, add_files
    and set_mkisofs_opts.
  * Make sure "make mirrorcheck" has been called before "make images".

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Cope with rolling back more than one package in case we go well
    over the disc size
  * Use a multiplier of 1.2 for HFS space - overkill, but it fixes
    the multi-arch DVD overflowing. Also log if we're doing HFS.
  * Tweak where we look for s390 boot files to make the weeklies work again.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Updated isolinux.bin to the version from syslinux 3.31-3.
  * Re-enable use of 64 bit detection, fixed now.

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Fix make_disc_trees.pl to not clash on unexcluded packages which contains
    regex special characters. Closes: #413506

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * forcd1-etch: remove network-console-config (not in Etch).
  * forcd1-etch: add kernel-package and module-assistant.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Fix path for creating splash image in boot-amd64. Closes: #413850.
  * Add the DEFAULT64 handling to boot-amd64 as well as boot-i386; needed
    in both so that things are setup the same regardless of the order in
    which the boot-$arch scripts are called
  * Fix the extra_image() function in both boot-i386 and boot-amd64 to make
    sure we don't end up overwriting extra images from one arch with those
    from the other. Now the multi-arch netinst should work for the installgui
    target for both arches
  * Check in current working versions of the tasks files.
  * Fix a silly bug in start_new_disc that would break on discs with
    local packages. Thanks to Ronny Aasen for the patch. Closes: #414818
  * Final *final* upload for etch; urgency high to get through the
    freeze.

debian-cd (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Support now added for multi-arch CDs/DVDs, including mixed
    binary/source discs. Multi-arch discs should be bootable on those
    multiple arches, modulo boot-sector clashes. Extra support added
    in boot-i386 and boot-amd64 to make the 2 main arches happily
    co-exist.

  * Disc sizing is now much more intelligent - sizes are defined
    depending on the disk type chosen at the start, and discs are now
    filled exactly to those sizes while files are added rather than
    the old up-front guessing method. Equally, the metadata on the
    disc (Packages, Packages.gz, Sources, Sources.gz, md5sums.txt) is
    generated as much as possible while this is happening to make the
    sizing code incredibly accurate. Using this method of disc sizing
    means that customising discs should be much easier/safer - either
    add custom contents at the start and debian-cd will fill the
    remainder of the disc, or afterwards roll back the packages on the
    disc and add extras later.

  * Source is now treated as (almost) just another arch, with most of
    the special casing for source hidden internally. If asking for
    source-only discs, they will simply be built using all the
    available sources. If combined with other arches, the sources will
    automatically be chosen to match the binary packages. Meeting GPL
    requirements was never so easy!

  * Removed lots of old cruft to clean up the codebase:
    + non-US support
    + woody support
    + lots of old support scripts that have been made redundant
    + significantly simpler Makefile, much easier to follow
    + old boot-$ARCH.calc files for estimating boot-file sizes are now
      (obviously) obsolete and therefore gone

  Other changes:

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Update tools/boot/*/boot-amd64 to use the correct isolinux
    splash image settings, and to insert $KERNEL_PARAMS correctly into
    isolinux.cfg.  Based on patches already implemented in boot-i386.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove 2.4 kernels from generate_di+k_list for i386.
  * Remove 2.2 kernel for mac from generate_di+k_list, as it's no longer in
    the archive.
  * Deal with new xfce-desktop task.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Merge patch from Petter to allow override of the default boot choice
    in syslinux using the ISOLINUX_DEFAULT config option. Closes: #393229

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Include brltty in generate_di+k_list.
  * Increase alpha hardcoded ramdisk_size to 20 mb, 16 is too small now.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Remove boot parameters that are no longer needed after switch to initramfs
    initrds for sparc and hppa.
  * tasks/exclude-etch: clean out obsolete entries.
  * tools/generate_di+k_list: generic suffix was dropped for amd64 kernels.
  * tools/generate_di+k_list: add new required packages for arm.
  * Update task-full-etch and task-essential-etch in tasks for D-I Etch RC1.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Update to the latest version of isolinux.bin, as found in syslinux
    version 3.31-1.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Add boot option "auto" for powerpc (yaboot) and sparc to support the
    installer's new auto-install functionality.
  * Update exclude-udebs:
    - S/390 installs do not support loading udebs from the CD, so exclude all
    - add debian-edu-archive-keyring-udeb
    - add ai-choosers, auto-install
    - add some new gtk frontend related udebs
    - globally exclude any discover udebs
    - clean up obsolete exclusions
  * Include "tape" images again for S/390.
  * Makefile: remove line continuation inside perl command as that breaks with
    GNU Make 3.81.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Change the default DEBVERSION from 3.2 to 4.0 to match etch.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add new language tasks to task.list.
  * Add files to support building KDE CDs/DVDs. These would be images
    hardcoded to install the KDE desktop task, and to create them, configure
    CONF.sh as follows:
      TASK=tasks/Debian_etch-kde
      KERNEL_PARAMS='tasks="kde-desktop, standard"'
      MAXCDS=1
      NOSOURCE=1
  * Add similar files for Xfce.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Include floppy disk images again for i386.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Split final md5sum of images out from Makefile into tools/imagesums;
    if we've made jigdo files then *don't* waste time running md5sum on
    the images as well!
  * Add the build date/time into a few more places so people can see them
    more easily; add the build time into the .disk/info file.
  * DEVEL BRANCH MERGE: Change mkisofs_opts usage: add a shell function
    for the boot-$arch scripts to use rather than simply appending to the
    $N.mkisofs_opts file directly. Needed for forthcoming multi-arch
    support.
  * Stop using the silly .raw extension for output images, use .iso instead
  * Improve support for different disk types. Specify DISKTYPE in CONF.sh,
    and it will affect both the output name later (so it's now possible to
    distinguish between CDs and DVDs). Defaults to CD if not otherwise
    set. DISKTYPE will be used more in the future for sizing too, but that
    merge can wait a while longer yet. Closes: #364122
  * Use DISKTYPE and COMPLETE values to create the file .disk/cd_type for
    the installer to use.
  * Add bpalogin near the top of the task list, as requested a long time
    ago. Closes: #231583
  * Dump the mkisofs command-line used for each CD into .disk/mkisofs
    as we make it. Closes: #258099

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Fixed double target in yaboot.conf; reported on IRC by jbrand.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add a temporary hack in Debian_etch-kde to use sid d-i, to get a fixed
    preseed that supports preseeding of tasks.
  * build.sh: Don't force IMAGETARGET to bin-official_images when NOSOURCE
    is set, if IMAGETARGET is also already set, as in a kde cd build.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Remove sh from the arch list in generate_di_list, to make builds quieter.
  * Another devel branch merge: Change tools/grab_md5 to also look for
    md5sums in the installer suite as well as the archive suite in
    case they're different. Also removed old woody support, to clean
    up the code a little. Updated Makefile and update-cd to match the
    command-line interface change.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * tasks/exclude-etch: clean up packages no longer in the archive.
  * tools/generate_di+k_list: no longer include kernel-image packages for
    powerpc as we don't support 2.4 based installs anymore. Closes #401429.
  * Daily builds for amd64 now done by Andreas Barth; with thanks to
    Kurt Roeckx for his past builds.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Include prep support on powerpc images again.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add Packages and Sources files to the Release file; clean up the
    checksums. Closes: #402267
  * Lower-case package names at various points to work around apt bug
    #402354. Fixes the long-standing warnings from list2cds about "Use
    of uninitialized value in string comparison", and allows some poor
    packages to make it onto CDs for the first time...
  * Improve performance: rewritten tools/make_disc_trees in perl so we
    can call add_packages directly as a perl function rather than via
    fork/exec all the time. Re-arranged tools/add_packages to make
    this work.
  * Improved logging in add_packages.
  * When we've finished making a CD tree in make_disc_trees.pl,
    re-compress the gzipped Sources and Packages. Workaround for bug
    #402482 in busybox gunzip code.
  * Don't put ppc boot files on discs >1.
  * Add more hfs options to m68k discs, to match ppc.
  * Make list2cds more verbose in log output, especially when
    dependencies have failed so a package can't be added.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * CONF.sh: case can handle empty variables fine; whitespace cleanup.
  * CONF.sh: don't determine ARCHES if already set; don't export CPU and
    KERNEL.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Update documentation to at least vaguely match how things work.
  * Added support for hook scripts in a few places around the CD
    creation process, to help people customise their CDs. Quite a
    lot of refactoring needed in make_disc_trees.pl needed to do that.
  * Removed more cruft:
    + old defs in CONF.sh
    + old defs and rules in the Makefile
    + tools/add_secured
    + don't depend on jigdo-file any more
    + don't depend on apt-utils any more - we don't use apt-ftparchive now
    + don't depend on debootstrap any more - we grab and use the
      latest version direct from the archive instead these days
    + don't suggest binutils-multiarch, we haven't needed that for mipsel
      CDs since woody!
    + remove the SKIPMIRRORCHECK variable, now completely obsolete
    + change the mkisofs dep from (mkisofs | mkhybrid) to
      (mkisofs | genisoimage)
    + remove Recommends on debianutils
    + remove Suggests on palo - we grab and use the correct version
      direct from the archive instead these days
    + remove Suggests on delo - we grab and use the correct version
      direct from the archive instead these days
  * Other cleanups:
    + Make build_all.sh work again, adapting build.sh
    + Promote Suggests: on netpbm, syslinux to Recommends:
    + Make make_disc_trees.pl and start_new_disc fail better on errors

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Add linux-image-2.6-prep for powerpc.
  * Create a new tasks/forcd1-etch file and remove old cruft.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Gunzip the installation manual in .txt and .pdf format, so it's
    useful on other platforms too.
  * As a last-minute step before building images, fill in the TOTALNUM
    value in the README files in the root of each image.
  * Re-implemented exclude/unexclude support in make_disc_trees.pl instead
    of in list2cds. Slight changes in semantics - the new code supports
    regular expressions for matching package names (to make it easier to
    exclude groups of related packages), and EXCLUDE<m> should be used in
    preference to EXCLUDE for packages that are just being shifted to
    later in the set by using UNEXCLUDE<n>.
  + Slightly change the output naming of the disc images to make it safer
    to produce more then one type of multi-arch disc
  * In start_new_disc, make sure that we call the (badly-named) add-bin-doc
    so that we get README.html and README.txt created even for source discs.
  * Cleanup of Etch version of REAMDE.html.in - use "disc" or "CD/DVD" rather
    than "CD" in many places.
  * Fix whitespace issue in boot-amd64. Closes: #406320. Thanks to Matthew
    King for the patch.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Added an update-tasks target to the Makefile and moved the code out of
    file header comments to there. Fix some bugs in passing.
  * List packages for the various specific desktop tasks ahead of the non-key
    packages for the general desktop task. Along with changes in tasksel 2.60
    this should lead to a generally more useful set of packages on the desktop
    CDs; instead of filling up with OOo, it will fill up with things specific
    to the desktop environment.
  * Updated task lists.
  * Moved interesting-fromcd23 down to come after software from tasks in
    priority.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Final (!?) upload before etch - time to actually close lots of these
    bugs, and get the new code into a package.

debian-cd (2.2.25) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove net-drivers access floppy from full CD images.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Consistently change location for installation guide to /doc/manual
    on the CD.
  * Update author (and timestamp) in README.
  * Colin Watson has taken over daily d-i builds for PowerPC.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Fix to tools/grab_md5: when building the md5-list, DO NOT use the
    "current" symlink in the d-i directories - that causes jigdo problems
    later on. Use the real dirs (as dated) instead.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Remove exclusion of openbsd-inetd for Etch as it is now the prefered
    dependency from netbase. For some reason debootstrap requires both inetd
    packages, so don't exclude netkit-inetd.
    Makes full/netinst images have base_installable again.
  * Thiemo Seufer has resumed building images for mips.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Only tell mkisofs to use the prep initrd if it's available (which it
    currently isn't for 2.6.16).

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Fix to tools/grab_md5: reset the file and dir name after each source
    package is finished with.
  * Add extra debug in tools/boot/etch/boot-i386

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * ths has taken over mipsel builds
  * Add sudo to generate_di+k_list, it's needed for installs w/o a root user.
  * Add support to boot/etch/boot-i386 for adding gtk images. If the
    isolinux files include .with26+gtk, include gtk initrd along with the
    2.4 kernel. If .withgtk, include gtk initrd along with the default
    (presumably 2.6) kernel.
  * i386 has stopped building because the el-torito boot images were turned
    off (due to size issues). Fix this by not failing if the el-torito images
    arn't there.
  * d-i doesn't include bast images anymore, drop from boot-arm.
  * Update task.list adding more language tasks.
  * Update task-essential-etch build recipe to exclude the kde-desktop
    task since it won't fit on the CD.
  * Move kde-desktop to end of task.list for same reason.
  * Update task-full-etch to current tasksel.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add better GNU/kFreeBSD support in setting ARCH in CONF.sh.
    Closes: #327470

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Applied patch from smarenka to add 2.6 kernels for m68k, also 2.4 kernels
    for appropriate m68k subarches, and also emile, amiboot, atari-bootstrap,
    and initramfs-tools for m68k.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add extra arm kernels and more utilities into the task lists.
    Closes: #373225

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Correct url to the amd64 dailies.
  * Add gtk initrd to amd64 images if available.
  * Add autorun file to amd64 images if there's a README.html, same as for
    i386.
  * Add pcmciautils-udeb to udeb_include lists; something needs to pull it
    in and like pcmcia-cs-udeb its priority won't.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Wouter Verhelst has taken over daily d-i builds for powerpc.
  * AMD64 d-i images are now available from people.d.o.
  * Add cryptsetup to first CD; needed for installations using encrypted
    partitions.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add 686 kernels, since the netinst CD is much larger and can now easily
    fit them and this makes the CD much more attractive for many users.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Drop 2.4 support for sparc64; switch from 2.4 to 2.6 for sparc32.
  * Exclude 2.4 kernel udebs for sparc and s/390 (s/390 has switched to 2.6).
  * Include only 2.6 kernel images for sparc.
  * Update to libdevmapper1.02.
  * No need to include yaird for m68k.
  * Drop initrd-tools for ia64, powerpc and sparc.
  * Include initramfs-tools instead of yaird for ia64 and sparc.
  * No initramfs generator needed for mips, mipsel and m68k.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Switch from 2.4 to 2.6 kernels for arm, mips and mipsel.
  * Switch from yaird over to initramfs-tools for arm.
  * Much simplified generate_di+k_list - mips and mipsel don't need script
    fragments any more.
  * Added elilo for i386.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Update task-essential-etch.
  * Update task.list to include all the new language tasks.
  * Update task-full-etch.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Mips has dropped r5k-ip22 kernels and gained r5k-ip32. And r5k-ip32
    doesn't have CD boot support yet, so don't attempt to use the cdrom
    boot image.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * There are no "tape" images with 2.6.16 for S/390.
  * Exclude floppy and el-torito images for i386 as they are not being built.
  * Update exclude-udebs lists.
  * Exclude 2.4.27 kernel packages from CD1 for sparc and s/390.
  * Exclude 2.6.15 kernel header and image packages from CD1.
  * Exclude 2.6.16 xen and vserver kernel  packages from CD1.
  * Update generate_di+k_list to include libsysfs2.
  * Update popularity contest data for etch.
  * Update generate_di+k_list to include libdiscover1.

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Add more features to get_diskusage.pl, making it easier to track
    dependencies and rejected packages.
  * Correct splash screen generation for sarge and etch, making sure the
    correct background colour (black) is selected.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Try to fix the "unofficial development version" bug on official CDs.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Include libc6-i686 in generate_di+k_list, base-installer will
    soon begin installing this onto machines that can use it.
    (To regain some space, libc6-amd64 will soon stop being standard priority,
    and drop off.)
  * On sparc, include libc6-sparcv9 and libc6-sparcv9b, which base-installer
    will also pull in.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Cope with cdrom64 -> cdrom renaming for powerpc64 subarchitecture.

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * [powerpc] Added a rescue option to yaboot.conf as well as the pegasos boot
    script.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Remove obsolete devfs=mount,dall and init=/linuxrc options from
    yaboot.conf and pegasos boot script.
  * Remove init=/linuxrc from hppa.

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Applied patches that are being in use at O.S. Systems and that are
    useful to others:
    - allow to use different name for final iso image;
    - allow to set the script to be used in debootstrap to check if all
      base need package are present.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Introduce new environment variable NOSOURCE that allows to build CD images
    using a local mirror that does not contain source files. This new variable
    obsoletes setting IMAGETARGET, though that is still supported for
    backwards compatibility. Closes: #320205.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Update the suggested DVD size in CONF.sh to a saner number
  * Re-sync CONF.sh over debian/CONF.sh
  * Minor changes to README.html.in and generation of README.html:
    cope with unofficial, official beta and official release CDs
    better. Let's not repeat the sarge mistake. Closes: #312604
  * Trivial updates to update-cd

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Update base-etch and popularity-contest-etch in tasks.
  * Update task-full-etch and task-essential-etch in tasks.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Update Dependencies to allow installation/use on GNU/kFreeBSD. Thanks
    to Petr Salinger for the patch. Closes: #378977
  * Fix KERNEL_PARAM breakage. Thanks to Vagrant Cascadian for the patch,
    closes: #387255
  * Removed reference to obsolete "mirrorcheck" target in the README
    file. Closes: #384064.
  * s/sarge/etch/ and s/3.1/3.2/ in CONF.sh
  * Last upload ready for the etch release (hopefully)

debian-cd (2.2.24) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Bdale Garbee ]
  * update lists of udebs for hppa to reflect kernel name changes, etc

  [ Richard Hirst ]
  * Fix ramdisk_size value for hppa for both etch and sarge

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Update for Sparc:
    - sparc64: switch to 2.6.12 kernel; make CD multiboot 2.6 and 2.4,
      using 2.6.12 by default
    - sparc32: drop 2.6 kernel support as it has no 2.6.12 kernel
    - restructure silo.conf with proper support for install, expert and
      rescue boot options

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove contrib/testingcds. For now the entire setup directory used to
    build Debian CDs is in svn at svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/debian-cd/setup
  * Point sid symlinks at etch.
  * Now build etch CDs by default.
  * Remove DH_CODENAME unset from CONF.sh, to allow it to be passed in
    via the environemtn. Closes: #326814
  * Remove Debian_sid task, which dates from before woody and should not be
    used.
  * Don't hardcode the path to debootstrap. And assume there is a debootstrap
    available, as it is a dependency.
  * Since debootstrap is in sbin, add sbin to PATH.
  * Remove other random hadcoded paths to programs in bin.
  * generate_di+k_list: Deal with kernel package name change. All arches
    with 2.6 kernels will now include only linux-image packages.
  * generate_di+k_list: Add some mips and mipsel subarches that are new in
    etch or were missing before.
  * generate_di+k_list: Use kernel-image-2.4-<subarch> and
    linux-image-2.4-<subarch> packages for as many architectures as we can,
    instead of enumerating the versions of the kernels to include. Much
    cleaner and more robust and will make d-i more robust as well.
  * Update task.list with new etch (and some old sarge) tasks.
  * Update task-full-etch and improve the generation recipe.
  * Change debootstrap --print-debs calls to pass debootstrap a mirror to use
    and a temporary directory to work in, so it will avoid downloading the
    Packages files from its hardcoded mirror, and work on amd64 and other
    situations with a non-official Debian mirror. Neccessary since the new
    version of debootstrap has dependency resolution enabled by default.
  * Don't chmod amiboot if it doesn't exist.

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Fixed powerpc cd builds, added powerpc64 kernels to etch/sid, dropped
    2.6.8 and remaining 2.4.27 kernels, except the nubus/apus ones. Added IBM
    chrp boot files. (Closes: #328274)

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Order task-essential-etch using task.list, and regen to match current
    tasksel.
  * Add acpid to generate_di+k_list so it's on the netinst.
  * Add more udebs to excludes trying to trim the netinst size down.
  * Exclude cdebconf from CD1s to prevent both it and debconf being pulled in
    by | dependencies. cdebconf isn't usable right now and has a large
    dependency chain.
  * Exclude inetutils-inetd and openbsd-inetd from CD1 for similar resons.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * generate_di+k_list: Add hfsutils for powerpc; it's no longer in base but
    yaboot-installer needs it.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * For full CD/DVD builds, check that we have an "extra" override
    containing task info. If not, use the sid override instead.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add default UDEB_EXCLUDE files that differ for businesscard, netinst, and
    full CDs.
  * Make the full CD have apt-mirror-setup in its udeb_exclude file, to avoid
    that component being installed to satisfy apt-setup's dependency on it (I
    hope), so that the user is not unncessarily asked for a mirror during a
    full CD install, but is still asked for one during installs from the
    smaller CDs.
  * Add initramfs-tools to generate_d-i+k_list

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Merged in MAJOR changes for jigdo creation - the long-separated JTE
    patch.
  * Split out the actual ISO/jigdo creation code from the Makefile into
    tools/make_image

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Explicitly list ppp and pppoeconf in generate_d-i+k_list, since they are
    not installed by debootstrap and we do want them on netinst CDs.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Split out the code that copies debs into the temporary trees and
    creates Packages files from the Makefile into tools/add_debs
  * Split out the code that copies sources into the temporary trees and
    creates Sources files from the Makefile into tools/add_source_packages

  * MAJOR CHANGE: Stop using apt-ftparchive to generate the Packages
    files on each CD/DVD; instead grab the details for each package
    directly from the Packages file in the archive. MUCH MUCH faster,
    and uses less code too. Affected scripts:

    + tools/scanpackages now just generates Release files. argv[1]
      used to be "scan" or "install", but no longer used

    + tools/add_debs slightly simplified - old code removed

    + tools/add_packages now dumps out Packages file fragments as each
      .deb and .udeb is copied into the temporary trees

    + WARNING: Any uses of the "before-scanpackages" hook may now
      break - shout if you're affected.

  * Fix the new Packages file generation to cope with LOCAL packages
    too. A simple change to add checking for /local/ ; hopefully it
    will do the trick.

  * Use "|" rather than "/" as a sed separator in the etch boot-amd64
    and boot-i386 scripts. Closes: #342344

  * Add the ppptp-linux package to CD#1. Quick hack adds this from the
    Makefile for now; FIXME later... Closes: #255367

  * Minor change to correct the README - BASEDIR var means we don't
    have to cd to /usr/share/debian-cd/ any more. Closes: #280191

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Update base-etch with current debootstrap, and also update the recipe to
    create it due to changes in debootstrap.
  * Remove exim4 from the netinst CDs by adding further insane cruft to the
    insane cruft already in the Makefile. (debootstrap no longer installs an
    MTA, so this should save some useful space on the netinsts)
  * Remove lvm10 from generate_di+k_list, d-i uses lvm2 now.
  * Audited all the apt-install commands in d-i, and added these packages
    to generate_di+k_list: pcmciautils, dosfsutils (barely needed),
    udev, installation-report, palo, elilo, sibyl, sibyl, colo, powerpc-utils,
    silo, vmelilo.
    Some of the bootloaders were alredy included via debootstrap, but as they
    are being removed from there, it's better to add them explicitly here.
  * Remove iso-codes from netinst, not used.
  * Drop floppies from i386 netinst and businesscard; this will make the
    netinst small enough to fit on 128 mb usb keychains again.
  * Deal with 386 -> 486 name change in kernel images.
  * Exclude ttf-cjk-compact-udeb.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Cope with mipsel boot images moving location. Closes: #349563.
  * Make sure that all the scripts use Packages.gz rather than Packages
    when looking up metadata in the archive - Packages is deprecated.
  * Cope better with badly-formatted stanzas in Sources.gz

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Exclude reiser4progs udebs from CD, since there is no reiser4 in the
    Debian kernel.
  * Exclude libreiserfs0.3-udeb from CD, no longer used by parted.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add an initial copy of boot-amd64.calc for etch

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * For etch, pick up the installation guide from the appropriate
    package in the archive rather than from the d-i area.
  * Add missing envvar checks in tools/generate_di*_list scripts.
  * arm: risc* flavours are no longer built. Closes: #351818.
  * Martin Michlmayr has temporarily taken over daily d-i builds for mips
    from Thiemo Seufer.
  * Kyle McMartin is now taking care of HPPA daily builds.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Switch alpha to 2.6 kernels.
  * Add linux-image-2.6-footbridge and linux-image-2.6-s3c2410
    arm kernels as d-i now uses these.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Fix the environment variable checks in tools/generate_di+k_list.
  * Update the boot-sparc scripts to improve the algorithm for finding
    the right version of silo to use - grab the filename from the
    appropriate Packages file rather than looking in the silo
    directory in the pool.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * generate_di+k_list: Switch initamfs generator to per-arch,
    based on what base-installer installs:
    - initramfs-tools on i386, amd64, alpha, powerpc, arm
    - yaird on hppa, ia64, mips, mipsel, sparc, m68k

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Added icon to powerpc/chrp bootinfo.txt, which will allow booting on IBM
    RS6K and pSeries. Closes: #352672

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Mipsel boot images haven't actually moved yet in etch. Cope with this
    - fall back to the old location if the new one isn't there.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * generate_di+k_list:
    - switch to initramfs-tools by default for hppa
    - include openssh-server; is installed when network-console is used
    - add libsysfs1; is not included otherwise because the udeb provides it

debian-cd (2.2.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Raphael Hertzog
    - Patch from Sven Luther for pegasos support already applied
      by Steve McIntyre. Closes: #311925
  * Steve McIntyre
    - Added sed hack to make sarge appear as "stable" in the Release
      files we generate on the CDs (for the sarge release). Removed the
      hack sgain before the 2.2.23 package build.
    - Download the release notes and try to fit them onto
      CD#1. Updated sarge's README.html.in to point to them
    - Updated tools/add-bin-doc to stop warnings on this.
    - Added patch from Sven Luther to add a forth script to make
 	  ppc/pegasos easier to boot.  Closes: #311925
    - Re-add the kernel-headers packages to match kernel images (only
      on i386 and amd64). Closes: #249386
    - Made list2cds more verbose
    - Added tools/sarge/upgrade-hppa.sh and tools/sarge/upgrade-sparc.sh
      to install the upgrade-kernel bits on CD#1
    - Added tools/dedicated_source: simple script used to add extra
      source packages onto _binary_ CDs. Used for the amd64 sarge release
      so far.
    - Added patch from Frans Pop to use $CODENAME for exclusions.
      Closes: #320206
    - We no longer need to use md5sum.textutils, as dpkg no longer ships a
      non-64-clean version. We can now just use plain "md5sum".
      Closes: #313613
  * Joey Hess
    - Synced up all sarge changes to etch.
    - Use dpkg --print-architecture instead of now-deprecated
      --print-installation-architecture
    - Completed access cd-drivers transition.
    - d-i renamed syslinux.txt to boot.txt, us new name instead of
      renaming file from d-i.
    - Use isolinux config files included in the d-i debian-cd_info tarball
      so it does not need to be maintained in both places.
    - Repository moved to svn, update docs to reflect move.
    - Add hw-detect-full to exclude list for etch, renamed to disk-detect.
    - Switch mipsel to use my builds.
    - Applied s390 boot support patch by Frans Pop. Closes: #318021
    - partman udeb renamed to partman-base
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - Changed m68k boot for etch to handle etch changes in d-i.

debian-cd (2.2.22) unstable; urgency=critical

  * Steve McIntyre
    - Prepared YA "last before sarge" debian-cd release
    - Urgency "Critical" to make sure we make it in...
  * Joey Hess
    - Add post-sarge udebs rescue-check, initrd-preseed, and preseed-common
      to the udeb exclude list since these will be/are inluded on sid initrds.
    - Add etch directories; point sid symlinks to them.
    - Add rescue stanzas to etch isolinux.cfg. Rescue mode is supported in
      post-sarge d-i images only.
    - Add support for f4.txt that is for systems with the 2.6 kernel.
    - Exclude new mouse-modules udebs from CDs until something in d-i uses
      them.
    - debian-installer task files renamed to include distro name and branched
      for etch.
  * Steve McIntyre
    - Make woody's post-boot-mipsel script cope with extra fields in the
      output of sarge's isoinfo
    - Add Suggests: on netpbm and syslinux. Closes: #301345
    - Count the total number of binary and source discs better; sarge can
      have more than 9 CDs, so ?.packages doesn't cut it any more.
    - Don't copy the whole d-i cdrom directory onto CD1 for amd64.
      Closes: #306926
    - Don't copy boot.img.gz onto amd64 CD1.
    - Added Manty's testingcds script as an example of debian-cd use
    - Updated sarge task lists to match the latest sarge CD build
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Allow the usage of a local mirror of the daily d-i builds to be used
      for sid_d-i builds, this is done by setting DI_WWW_HOME=default and
      DI_DIR=/path/to/the/mirror
    - Add autorun capabilities to i386 cds so that instead of getting the
      "what do you want Windows to do" question under XP, we get the html
      README started. Closes: #185238
    - Make the jigdos use the same naming scheme as the isos, as per my
      proposal to the list.
    - Add some amd64 patches from Goswin: Fixed boot-amd64 and added
      some packages missing on netinsts.
    - Port to etch previous changes I commited for sarge.

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Wed, 01 Jun 2005 13:04:33 +0100

debian-cd (2.2.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steve McIntyre:
    - Prepared YA "last before sarge" debian-cd release.
  * Raphael Hertzog
    - One line patch to correct a five year old bug that nobody noticed !
      Closes: #285382
    - Change maintainer to "Debian CD Group <debian-cd@lists.debian.org>" and
      put myself into Uploaders (as well as Santiago Garcia Mantinan & Steve
      McIntyre). That's because I'm not keeping up well enough with debian-cd
      and I need more people involved in managing bugs.
    - Apply patch from Horms <horms@debian.org> to fix some problems with
      inclusion of local udebs. Closes: #258029
    - Apply another patch from horsm@debian.org to try to look for d-i images
      in "local" dirs first. Closes: #258026
    - Use LC_ALL=C when calling apt-cache since the output is now translated.
      Closes: #290959
  * Steve McIntyre
    - Substantially updated update-cd:
       - Cope with Woody r3 updates taking more than 1 CD per
         architecture.
       - (Optionally) use JTE mkisofs extensions to create jigdo
         files directly.
    - Added amd64 support in several places, looking (oddly) very similar
      to i386 for now. The help texts displayed by isolinux at boot still
      need updating - HELP!
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - m68k: add kernel-image-2.4.27-amiga to debian-installer+kernel.
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Update debian-installer's tasks.
    - Update calc script and calc files.
    - Make i386 cds 8.3 filenaming compatible again.
    - Workaround the two kernels problem on hppa.
    - Fix the kernel-image-2.4.27-amiga thing on generate_di+k_list.
    - Add support for arm to generate_di+k_list.
  * Joey Hess again:
    - Since amd64 is not on standard debian mirrors, and generate_d-i+k_list
      must be runnable on them, make it chack for absence of amd64 Packages
      files and add a dummy kernel for amd64. This will need to be manually
      kept up-to-date by the amd64 people for now.
    - Didn't fix generate_di_list the same way, since doing so would be too
      hard. Next time tasks/debian-installer is updated using this script on
      a machine w/o the unofficial amd64 archive, the am64 info in the file
      will be lost.
    - Add DO NOT EDIT warning messages to generated files in cvs.
    - Check and revert manual modifications to tasks/base-sarge. This file is
      automatically generated and those mods would have been lost:
        - Add fileutils to generate_d-i+k_list, "until kernels get fixed",
          whatever that means.
        - arcboot was already in generate_d-i+k_list.
    - Update tasks/debian-installer+kernel using generate_d-i+k_list.
    - Sort package lists in tasks/base-sarge to ease comparisons when
      updating.
    - Update tasks/base-sarge for debootstrap 0.2.45. This includes the
      following removals:
         - aboot: already listed in debian-installer+kernel
         - gcc-3.2-base, libdb2, libgcrypt1, libgnutls7, libident,
           libdb2, libtasn1-0: obsolete
         - modconf: obsoleted by d-i
         - setserial: not base anymore
         - slang1: turned into slang1a-utf8
         - libident: not needed by base anymore
         - lilo: in debian-installer+kernel
         - mbr: not installed anymore
         - pcmcia-cs: in debian-installer+kernel
         - syslinux: not installed
         - "filesutils": typo; fileutils in generate_d-i+k_list for m68k
         - quik: in debian-installer+kernel
         - yaboot: in debian-installer+kernel
         - arcboot: in debian-installer+kernel
         - delo: in debian-installer+kernel
      And the following additions:
         - libdb4.2, libgcrypt11, libgcrypt7, libgnutls10, libgnutls11,
           libgpg-error0, libtasn1-2: new libraries
         - console-tools: now installed by debootstrap even on s390
    - Exclude all the new amd64 kernel images from cd #1, no space.
    - Forgot to exclude old kernel-image-2.6.7-1-686-smp from cd #1.
    - Add network-console-config to forcd1 since it's needed by the
      network-console udeb. Closes: #279238
    - Exclude xmail from CD1 (new MTA), and exim (old MTA)
    - Exclude some kernel-headers with no matching kernel-images from CD1.
    - Update task lists to reflect tasksel changes.
    - Exclude new kernels from CD1.
    - Switch mips daily builds to new builds by ths.
    - Update task files for tasksel 2.22.
    - Exclude more new kernel images from CD1.
    - Stop hardcoding sid as the distribution to take the installation manual
      from, use DI_CODENAME instead.
    - Add OMIT_MANUAL variable, which can be set to 1 to drop the install
      manual from small CDs to save space. We will probably be adding several
      new translations, and possibly PDFs, and that would use too much space
      on the small CDs.
    - Also make the README link to the manual on the Debian web site if
      OMIT_MANUAL=1.
    - Update the README to mention manual translations are available.
    - More README updates from patch by Frans Pop. Closes: #300301
    - libdevmapper1.00 renamed to libdevmapper1.01, update debian-installer
      task. Closes: #298724
    - Sparc daily builds moved.
  * Bdale Garbee
    - update tasks and tools to make 2.6.8 kernels primary on hppa
    - add ramdisk_size=16384 to palo call in post-boot-hppa
  * Colin Watson
    - Disable CD timeout on powerpc.
    - Add localechooser to exclude-udebs.

debian-cd (2.2.20) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Joey Hess
    - Remove bogus init=/linuxrc, we have not had a linuxrc in d-i for a long
      time and I don't know how that managed to work.
    - Update path to ia64 cdrom/boot.img.
    - Tweaked exclude-udebs-i386, removing fat-modules as it's not available
      otherwise if booting from floppy, and removing excludes of partconf,
      partitioner, and discover2-data-udeb, which are not in unstable for i386
      any longer.
    - Updated exclude-udebs to match the current CD initrd package list.
    - Access floppy reorg.
    - Sparc daily builds moved to joshk's builds.
    - Update tasks for 2.4.27 and 2.6.8 kernels.
    - Remove access floppies to save space on netinsts. Also remove
      net-drivers floppy and some other things not really needed for install
      from CD.
    - Add 2.6 kernels to ia64 netinst CDs (and incidentially, update to
      2.4.27).
    - Drop i386 floppies that have gone away in d-i.
    - Put 2.4, not 2.6 kernels on hppa cd.
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - Add support for m68k reorganization.
    - Bump m68k 2.4 kernels to 2.4.27.
    - Handle missing m68k/bvme6000 floppy.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - New variable SPLASHPNG pointing to replacement splash image on i386.
  * Kenshi Muto
    - Fix cp routine around EXTRA_DISK_IMAGES in tools/boot/sarge/boot-i386
      (add space to cp arguments)
    - Add floppy/asian-root.img, floppy/mideast-root.img and
      floppy/cyrillic-root.img to EXTRA_DISK_IMAGES (but may it be treated
      as DISK_IMAGES?)
    - Fix typo in test evaluation. (tools/boot/sarge/boot-i386)
    - Add localization-config.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add "--" end of installer kernel params markers to yaboot.conf.
    - Drop compatibility with old powerpc 2.4/2.6 d-i image layout, since
      the changed image layout reached sarge a while ago.
    - Remove 2.4 images from power3 and power4; those few who want them can
      netboot.
    - Remove 2.6 PReP images from power3 and power4, as no such machines
      exist.
    - Hardlink powerpc and powerpc/minimal vmlinux files together, since
      they're identical.
    - Remove powerpc-small-pmac kernel from the netinst. base-installer
      hasn't installed it since April, and according to Sven it's only
      useful for building floppies.
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Try to fix powerpc DVD builds via -hfs-parms MAX_XTCSIZE.
    - Add prep powerpc support.
    - Update debian-installer tasks.
    - Add tools/calc script to update .calc files with up to date
      estimations on the iso size parameters.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Add arcboot to the mips tasks/base-sarge list, like it is done for
      other bootloaders.
    - Add a default bootfile named sashARCS for mips, aliased to r4k-ip22.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Add ramdisk_size=16384 to silo.conf. closes: #274958
  * Steve McIntyre
    - Another upload before sarge.

debian-cd (2.2.19) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Steve McIntyre
    - (Hopefully this time) Final medium-urgency upload to get a
      recent debian-cd in before the sarge release. A few bugfixes needed:
    - Removed silly build-dep-indep on mkisofs. Closes: #258018
    - Fixed typo in tools/boot/sarge/boot-i386. Closes: #267026
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Change build.sh to allow building non complete CDs, like netinsts.

debian-cd (2.2.18) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Steve McIntyre
    - Final medium-urgency upload to get a recent debian-cd in before
      the sarge release.
    - Update default version to sarge/3.1 for a sarge release.
    - Sarge is going to have more than 9 CDs; make sure we clean up all of
      the working dirs.
    - Removed the -T option to mkisofs. We don't need the TRANS.TBL files
      any more, and we should save the space.
    - Added support for SIZE_MULT_x when calculating full disc
      sizes. Best use is on m68k and powerpc images where HFS hybrid
      metadata seems to add ~10% to the size of the image.
    - Various updates to update-cd to cope with changes r0->r2.
    - Updated copy of CONF.sh in debian directory to match the working copy in .
    - Small lintian fixes.
  * Raphael Hertzog
    - Add missing Build-Depends-Indep. Closes: #258018
    - Remove debian-keyring.tar.gz from the doc dir.
    - Don't include Contents-$ARCH.gz on netinst/businesscard CD.
  * Joey Hess
    - Include sarge installation manual on sarge CDs.
    - Remove install/doc, and just use doc/install.
    - Patch from Thiemo Seufer to add mips and mipsel kernels.
      Also, remove some packages from arches that do not need them.
    - Remove module-init-tools-udeb from the CD.
    - Remove raidtools2-udeb from the exclude list, while nothing depends on
      it, it can be handy for manually setting up raid.
    - discover has been renamed to discover1
    - On i386, include discover on the CD as well, this is discover verson
      2, and is used with the 2.6 kernel.
    - Based on user reports, remove the read-only, and pass "rw" to the kernel
      in silo.conf.
    - Include only 2.4 ia64 kernels on the d-i CD for now, the 2.6 ones
      are not a good choice ATM according to bdale.
    - silo.conf fixes.
    - Fix mirror_check to look under LOCALDEBS for files if it is set.
    - Add mdadm to the netinst CD, needed for software raid installs.
    - Add lvm2 (and dependencies libdevmapper1.00 and lvm-common)
      for new partman. Left lvm10 on the CD for now, remove later.
    - Add jfsutils to netinst cds.
    - Add usbutils to netinst cds, it'll be installed by a future version
      of hw-detect.
    - Add tools/get_diskusage.pl (originally by Petter).
    - Add update-popcon Makefile target (taken from Skolelinux).
    - Add a KERNEL_PARAMS variable, which can be used to add kernel parameters
      and is useful for creating things like CDs that install in critical
      priority mode. I only implemented it for i386 so far.
    - Add MAXCDS config variable, which forces debian-cd to stop after a given
      number of binary CDs.
    - Only exclude udebs from the CD that are in both the cd initrd and the
      hd-media initrd, since both use the CD. This adds back floppy-modules
      and firewire-core-modules.
    - Add new default udeb_include files (for to full CDs and DVDs) that
      include ethdetect and netcfg, to make network configuration happen in
      first stage, since the second stage cannot currently do any.
      Closes: #240458
    - Include debian-installer+kernel into Debian_sarge task to ensure all
      debs as well as udebs used by d-i are included.
    - Exclude newer versions of i386 kernels to save space. Leave 2.6.x-386
      kernels on the CD.
    - Update task-essential-sarge to tasksel 2.05. Fix the generator to work
      with post-2002 tasksels.
    - Update task-full-sarge and task.list to tasksel 2.05. The task.list was
      manually ordered to give desktop task priority, followed by servers,
      followed by languages.
    - NORECOMMENDS should be used for sarge official CD sets (getting full
      tasks is more important), and is on by default.
    - Add libfribidi0 to generate_di+k_list, needed for BIDI.
    - Switch CONF.sh to sarge.
    - Uncomment exclude lines.
    - Remove the boot.bat script and redundant and incorrect README.tools.
      The alternative is to maintain and document them.
    - Exclude kernel sources from popcon results, old data skews this badly.
    - Remove old kernel sources from interesting-fromcd23, and various other
      removals and updates.
    - Update the task lists and popcon again.
    - Stop excluding 686 and 686-smp kernels, as these are probably the most
      popular, and they fit on CD#1 now.
    - Add "--" end of installer kernel params markers to the isolinux.cfg.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Regenereated tasks/popularity-contest-sarge based on the current data.
    - Avoid kernel versions 2.4.24 and 2.6.3 on the first i386 CD, as we
      are currently using 2.4.25.

debian-cd (2.2.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed debian/conffiles (useless with debhelper 4).
  * Added aptitude on netinst CD (but not on businesscard CD).
    Closes: #220125, #219986
    It is already on CD1 of a normal CD set.
  * Kenshi Muto
    - Add jfbterm, unifont into forcd1, d-i+kernel (second stage of
      debian-installer needs them).
    - Add console-cyrillic, console-terminus, hotplug, iso-codes into forcd1,
      d-i+kernel.
  * Joey Hess
    - Add "expert" mode to isolinux.cfg for sarge.
    - Remove pump-udeb from all udeb_includes; netcfg depends on and
      uses dhcp-client-udeb.
    - Add appropriate kernel-pcmcia-modules package to
      debian-installer+kernel task for i386.
    - Update the yaboot boot.msg to match the one in d-i cvs.
    - Update the yaboot.conf to add expert and expert-safe boot modes.
    - Link the d-i INSTALLATION-HOWTO into doc/, if it exists.
    - Add my exclude_udebs lists, for general and i386, and modify
      generate_di_list to not include udebs from those lists onto the
      cdrom, to save space on the netinst cds. Closes: #215469
    - Use the d-i docs in sid instead of the woody boot floppies docs.
    - Add pcmcia-cs-udeb to sarge's i386_netinst_udeb_include, to support
      pcmcia installs.
    - Remove console-keymaps from all udeb_includes; they are included
      on the cdrom initrds.
    - Switch from netcfg-static/dhcp to just netcfg.
    - Split udeb_includes for businesscard and netinst; netinst does not
      need choose-mirror, while businesscard does.
    - Add wireless-tool-udeb to udeb_include for i386 and powerpc netinst
      and businesscard images.
    - Add pcmcia-cs onto the generate-di+k_list, now that is is not
      autoinstalled by debootstrap.
    - Document vga=771 boot option for laptops with screen problems.
    - Add the debian-edu udebs to the exclude list for netinst CDs, and
      remove the deleted di-utils-devicefiles.
    - Update boot/sarge/boot-i386 to use the new d-i image names.
    - Use d-i boot screens from the debian-cd_info.tar.gz.
      Closes: #220612, #221186
    - Remove the netboot initrd from netinst CDs, since d-i builds a mini-iso
      with this initrd on it, and since the d-i help screen does not mention
      the net type.
    - Add xfsprogs and reiserfsprogs to generate_di+k_list.
    - Add lilo as well; it's not autoinstalled by debootstrap, but
      lilo-installer still uses it.
    - Increase the i386 isolinux ramdisk size to 10 mb; it's grown due to
      translatons and all the scsi drivers.
    - Drop lowmemcheck from the CD; it is in the initrd.
    - Add wireless-tools to generate_d-i+k_list
    - Remove the old partitioner from the CD for i386. (This should also be
      done for other arches for which it is not default)
    - Include all the powerpc kernels that d-i's base-installer currently
      could try to install on the CD.
    - Try to include some sparc kernels on the CD; it's probably better than
      including none..
    - Revamped the README.html, removing the old manual apt setup
      instructions, various references to woody, fixing the link to the LDP
      home page, dropping reference to the basically dead non-us section,
      removing confusing references to non-free being on the CD, dropping
      references to dselect, etc.
    - Fix layout of README.txt, adding missing <p>'s after headings.
    - Drop README.mirrors and README.non-US from the CDs.
  * Steve Langasek
    - Add fdisk-udeb to the list of needed debs for alpha
    - Use /dev/ram as the root device for aboot (alpha)
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Updated tasks/README with new location of popularity-contest results.
    - Regenereated tasks/popularity-contest-sarge based on the current
      data.
    - Avoid acorn-fdisk, cfdisk-utf8 and lots of kernels on the first CD.
      It should be enough with one kernel package on the first CD.
    - Make generated debian-installer list easier to read by adding
      arch info at the end of an #ifdef block.
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Add DI_CODENAME variable make it posible to build cds with a special
      debian-installer version.
    - Make Makefile remove dedication files except for current version.
    - Update debian-installer.* tasks
    - Add hppa kernels to generate_di+k_list
    - Add sarge boot scripts for hppa

debian-cd (2.2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated standards-version to 3.6.0.
  * Use debhelper 4 (build-depends on it, updated DH_COMPAT).
  * WARNING: potato is now mostly unsupported, some cruft has been
    removed that may have been useful for generating potato CDs.
  * Added debian-installer support. debian-installer is automatically
    used if $MIRROR/dists/$CODENAME/main/debian-installer exists.
    (however you have to require the inclusion of the udeb via the
    task mechanism, cf tasks/debian-installer for the current list)
  * Added all files for sarge (in tasks/ data/ and tools/).
  * Updated isolinux.bin from syslinux 1.75-1.
  * Tollef Fog Heen:
    - Make it possible to exclude contrib from the CDs. Useful if you only
      have a mirror of main.
    - The names of the bootable images have changed on
      people.d.o/~tfheen/d-i/images/daily, update download scripts to reflect
      that.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen:
    - Add CONTRIB flag to debian/CONF.sh.
    - Add support for BASE_INCLUDE and BASE_EXCLUDE, making files
      cdrom/.disk/base_include and .../base_exclude used by
      debian-installer.
    - Document BOOTDISKS.
    - Make disk number available in tools/add-bin-doc.
    - In woody, keep the time stamp of smb.bin when copying it to CD.
    - Add support for UDEB_INCLUDE and UDEB_EXCLUDE, making files
      cdrom/.disk/udeb_include and .../udeb_exclude used by
      debian-installer.
  * Apply patch from Petter Reinholdtsen for inclusion of
    Recommends/Suggests from the base system. Closes: #106903
  * Apply nice patch from Santiago Garcia Mantinan for building
    "netinst CDs" !
  * Don't check dependencies for udebs, they tend to be broken
    and we still want them on the CD.
  * Put good default values for UDEB_INCLUDE based on the value of
    INSTALLER_CD.
  * Many updates on the tasks files by Josip Rodin. Removed useless packages
    from sarge CD1... and so on.
  * Updated hfs.map with .sit info (for powerpc arch). Closes: #186837

    Thanks to Karsten Merker.
  * Updated README.sbm with more info provided by Santiago
    Marcia Mantinan.
  * Reordered some woody task files. Thanks to Philip Charles.
  * Added cpp in the Depends field. Closes: #145869
  * Fixed error message in Makefile. Closes: #146184
  * Updated tools/add_secured to work with all versions of md5sum
    (including the one that comes with dpkg >= 1.10).
  * Protect the call to add_secured by a stamp file. Closes: #147105
  * Provide a customised isolinux image. We don't need to
    recommend syslinux now.
  * Apply patch from Petter Reinholdtsen to put security updates on the cd.
  * Apply patch from Petter Reinholdtsen to preserve timestamps, making
    build.sh being able to run with -e set, report reserved space and
    the space debootstrap needs.  Also, handle boot-floppy directories
    without docs.
  * Make sure discover, read-edid and mdetect are on the first CD if
    possible.

debian-cd (2.2.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Updated the script to update tasks/base-woody. Closes: #138651
  * Anne commited stuff for inclusion of a local security.debian.org.
  * Added NOSUGGESTS in a similar way than NORECOMMENDS. Thanks
    to Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>.
  * Added "decompacted language packs" to the bootable CDs.
    Closes: #139179
  * Corrected name of kernel s/linux/linux.bin/ (why the hell
    do they need to change that name now ...). Closes: #139503
    Change has been made for arches where the latest bf are
    available. More may need to come for arches like sparc
    which are catching up with bf.
  * More changes of kernel name in anticipation of the upcoming
    boot floppies for sparc & alpha.
  * Change the order of flavors in the i386 CD set. First is "idepci",
    second "compact", third "bf2.4" and fourth the old default one. At
    least we have the language chooser on the first CD but it's still
    2.2 based. Reworked the MULTIBOOT code to take this into account.
  * Added capability to generate DVD-sized images. Use bc to calculate
    disk sizes in build.sh and build_all.sh, and use the textutils
    version of md5sum to avoid missing large file support in dpkg
    version. Specify the output image sizes in CONF.sh
  * Added ISOLINUX code (export ISOLINUX=yes in CONF.sh); this provides a
    "rescue floppy like" boot screen that allows choosing between kernel
    images, rather than loading the rescue disks directly from the boot
    sector.
  * Removed obsolete local-variables section from changelog.
  * Added default values into CONF.sh for isolinux support.
  * Change again the order of the boot images for i386.
    1: multiboot (isolinux) 2: vanilla 3: compact 4: idepci 5: bf2.4
  * Put TERM=vt102 for vanilla flavor as it seems to fix the borders
    of the boxes in a few cases.
  * Improved the test to see if we want non-free. Instead of -n "$NONFREE"
    it's now "${NONFREE:-0}" != "0" (same for EXTRANONFREE). Maybe
    should we do the same for the other boolean environment variables like
    LOCAL, SECURITY, SECURED ...
  * Changed the test for ISOLINUX and MULTIBOOT to be coherent with the other
    boolean variables.
  * Dropped old el-torito multiboot support. Documented the choice of
    isolinux in README.devel.
  * added ramdisk_size=8192 to palo commandline for hppa
  * Added empty boot-mips & boot mipsel.
  * Updated boot-alpha to conditionalize the inclusion of APB.
  * Reworked boot-ia64 to use hardlinks and so 1_NONUS.raw is built properly.
  * Reworked post-boot-hppa to hardcode path to palo, and to ensure
    1_NONUS.raw is built properly.
  * Added Smart Boot Manager image for people who want to boot ISOLINUX
    image on machine with BIOS which don't support them.

  * Adapted to new s390 boot-floppies 3.0.19 directory structure (Stefan
    Gybas <sgybas@debian.org>).
  * Updated boot-i386 for the boot-floppies 3.0.19.
  * Don't include the base-images-* directories on the CD. They
    are meant for people wishing to install by floppy (who download the
    floppy images from the net).
  * Corrected the priority to match the priority given in the override file.
  * CDs with .disk/kernel_installable have the disks-<arch> directories
    and those with .disk/base_installable have all the packages required
    by debootstrap.
  * Updated base-woody with debootstrap 0.1.17. Closes: #138357

  * Added extra file to help fine tune the CD sizes per archs
  * Edited boot-alpha to work (I hope) based on what was available in the
    README.txt in boot-floppies
  * Modified build_all.sh so that it puts each arch under a subdir and
    modified imagesums/pi-makelist to support the subdirs
  * Added FORCENONUSONCD1 support - move all non-US packages/sources to
    CD#1 of the set. We then make 2 copies of this, one with non-US and
    one without. Useful for people wanting to create non-US and US-safe
    CDs without having to spend so much disk space.
  * Added patch from Joey Hess for LOCALDEBS support. Closes: #66447
  * Added patch from Michael Schlueter (corrected cpp call when
    FORCENONUSONCD1 was not used)

debian-cd (2.1.92) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This version goes to frozen since it's used for building potato CD.
    Another one will follow once we have the final boot-floppies.
    But I already upload this one because I'm getting complaints since
    the old package doesn't work with the actual boot-floppies available
    on the mirror...
  * Added files for woody (yes, people already burn woody CD images)
  * Make the second CD bootable on i386 with the "compact" image.
  * Changes to installtools.sh, change to check for documentation
    directory name by $ARCH.
    -> This change will have to be removed when all arch will have synced
    boot floppies.
  * Changes to tools/potato/boot-i386 for support of the 2.2.3 bootdisks.
    Closes: #53529 #58304
  * In Makefile, if there are multiple versions of the
    bootdisks in the source tree, the section "boot:" seems to get
    confused. Not fixed. Temporary solution, move old i386 boot
    disks out of the source archive.
  * Added a file tasks/popularity-contest listing packages by order of
    usefulness (results given by the popularity contest of course). This
    file is included at the end of the Debian_potato task in order to
    include the packages that are widely used on the first CD if possible.
  * Added a bunch of set -e.
  * Added pi-makelist target to generate the *.list files used by the
    Pseudo Image Kit. Needs isoinfo in the cdwrite package.
  * Updated README and README.devel. Explained that the main source
    is on CVS and that patch should apply on the CVS tree not on the
    source package available on the Debian FTP.
  * Added possibility to include local packages on the CD set. Documented
    it. Closes: #50640
  * Documented the fact that TMP path must be on the same partition than
    the mirror. Closes: #59524

debian-cd (2.1.91) unstable; urgency=low

  * Splitted the boot scripts for slink & potato. Updated the Makefile
    to handle this.
  * Updated the tasks/Debian_potato to use the new task-* packages.
  * New boot-i386 which does use resc2880.bin (the tecra image has
    been removed since it does no more exist in the latest boot-floppies).
  * Can now build CD with bootdisks taken from somewhere else than
    the mirror (allow you to use your own boot floppies, notably those
    built with translated documentation).
  * The documentation from the boot-floppies are now installed
    in /install and /doc by the scripts tools/$CODENAME/installtools.sh
    It was needed since the documentation of the boot-floppies does
    differ from one dist to another ...
  * Removed some cruft which is no more needed (master for potato,
    status.i386).
  * Updated README to explain that the mkhybrid package in Debian
    does support the -F option. Closes: #50141

debian-cd (2.1.90-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to contrib because of the unzip and lha dependencies.
  * Corrected the boot-m68k script (bvme600 -> bvme6000).
  * YACS 0.5 :
  * ----------
  * tools/add_dirs: don't create section subdirectories for non-US.
  * tools/*: full slink compliance. Should build slink disk even with
    non-US. Thanks to the help of Filip Van Raemdonck <mechanix@dma.be>.
  * Makefile: added an upgrade target called when building
    official_images. It will call tools/$CODENAME/upgrade.sh if possible.
    Created this upgrade.sh file for slink.
  * YACS can/should generate complete slink images with this release.
    Please test. In particular for non-i386 CD images. I want to check
    if the scripts to make CD bootables are (still) working.
  * tools/apt-selection: removed some bashisms.
  * Many data has been splitted by codename. This is to allow
    us to build slink and potato CD without much troubles.
  * Updated the master file for potato. Added the old one for slink.
  * Status file is now automatically generated when a provided one
    is not available (data/$CODENAME/status.$ARCH).
  * build.sh build_all.sh: convenience scripts to build CD images.
  * YACS 0.4 :
  * ----------
  * New status file for potato i386.
  * When including packages listed in the status file check that they
    exist before.
  * Call dpkg-scansources for generating Sources.gz file on the source
    CD. And depends on dpkg-dev (>= 1.4.1.6) to be sure that we have it.
  * Add dependency to libdigest-md5-perl.
  * list2cds: try to select all suggested/recommended packages not only from
    packages explicitely selectionned but also from packages listed
    in dependencies.
  * list2cds: many little checks added, now generates a log.list2cds
    file (in the temp dir).
  * YACS 0.3 :
  * ----------
  * This version has herited nothing from the previous debian-cd
    package only the changelog has been added.
  * It can now build sources CD.
  * This package does now replace slink_cd and the old debian-cd.
    I'll close the bugs (after checking that the new debian-cd behaves
    correctly with the bug report situation) affected to those packages.
  * The Packages.cd files are generated correctly (the same way than
    slink_cd did).
  * Added the good dependencies. Closes: #25710, #36109, #27758
  * Some bugs are no more applicable. Closes: #24708, #25195, #31044, #24418
    Closes: #36115, #36228
  * No source URL in copyright file since this is a Debian native
    package. Closes: #36111
  * Full GPL isn't included. Closes: #36113
  * Missing newlines added. Closes: #36114
  * The README is a good documentation for building CD. Closes: #17540
  * Added the support for hooks. Closes: #36112
  * Added a link index.html -> install.html. Closes: #38402
  * Files are better placed. Closes: #36110
  * Rebuilding the Contents file is of no use. And if you really need
    it, you can do it yourself with the hook system. Closes: #36116
  * Internationalization is a boot-floppies problem. Closes: #25210
  * Tried miniunz but it lacks important feature like -L ... still
    uses unzip. And recommends it.

debian-cd (1.99.14-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This should really go in hamm, so that the scripts to build the CD's
    end up on the CD's.  Of course this will probably require a few attempts
    before the scripts here settle down, because other changes are still being
    made to hamm that affect these.
  * edit some README's and Configuration defaults.  Done with a -1 version
    so my diff's come out in the diff file
