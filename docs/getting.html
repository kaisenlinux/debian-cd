<h2>Development versions - using git</h2>

<p>debian-cd is actively maintained by a team of people, a mixture of
the initial developers and assorted users including the
debian-installer team. The main repository is stored in a git
repository on Debian's central git service (salsa):

<p><a href="https://salsa.debian.org/images-team/debian-cd"><code>https://salsa.debian.org/images-team/debian-cd</code></a></p>

<h2>Debian packages</h2>

<p>debian-cd is also packaged and distributed as normal as a debian
package. Be aware that the version of debian-cd needed can depend on
the target version of Debian for your CDs, for example building etch
CDs will need either a checkout from subversion or the very latest
packaged version. Debian testing versions are a moving target!</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>debian-cd development and support happens on the debian-cd mailing
list; see <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/">http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/</a>
for archives and details of how to subscribe.</p>
