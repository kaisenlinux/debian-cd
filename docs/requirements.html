<h1>debian-cd requirements</h1>

<p>debian-cd has a few dependencies, some obvious and some less
so. The packaged version in Debian depends on the key items that
<strong>must</strong> be installed, and recommends lots of others.</p>

<p>This recommendation works, as many of the deps are
optional. Exactly which sets of packages will be needed is determined
by the architectures you wish to build CDs for. On some architectures,
making bootable CDs needs extra support from other packages (e.g. palo
for hppa CDs).</p>

<p>The other important dependency for debian-cd cannot be represented
so easily - it needs a copy of parts of the Debian archive to be able
to build CDs. This includes the <code>doc</code>, and <code>tools</code>
directories from the root of the archive.
Be aware that before version 2.1 the commonly-used <code>debmirror</code>
package did not grab those directories when mirroring. An alternative to
<code>debmirror</code> is to use <code>rsync</code> to mirror the archive.
</p>

<p>For best performance, the mirror should be on a local disk and the
user running debian-cd should have permissions to be able to create
hard links on the same filesystem. It should be possible to run
without this, using symbolic links instead of hard links, but the code
to do this is not as well tested and can be expected to be much
slower.</p>

<p>For producing <a href="jigdo.html">jigdo</a> files, debian-cd uses a
patched version of <code>mkisofs</code> which can natively create
jigdo files. This needs mkisofs version 4:2.01+01a03-4 or newer, or
genisoimage in Debian.</p>
